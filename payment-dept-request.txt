3. Payment management side- Pending verification area, after verified the payment still at the same area as pending payments. In this case, its hard to check pending payment which paid earlier as will be more & more payment coming in.

SYSTEM ENGINEER ANSWER:
1. When Finance Admin, verified a submitted payment, it will create a payment in db, also delete this submitted payment.
2. we need to run a patch, to check is there any match verified payment and submitted payment, ( pick 5 column to check, if matched, mark the submited payment as deleted )
